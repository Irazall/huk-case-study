# Overview

This repository contains a case study that I had to work on for a job application at HUK-Coburg in 2025. The tasks deals with modeling the claim amount in the context of car insurances. The case study consists of several Quarto files that can be found in the folder `reports`. The data stems from the R-Package `CASDatasets`, Version 1.0-6 (2016) by Christophe Dutang [aut, cre], Arthur Charpentier [ctb]. The data are published [here](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=41214&status=active) (last retrieved 2025-03-07) and [here](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=41215&status=active) (last retrieved 2025-03-07). The full description of the task can be found in the file `introduction.pdf` (German only).

The slides I presented during the technical interview were partly auto-generated using [slidespeak.co](%3Chttps://slidespeak.co/). They can be found in the folder `slides` (German only).

All code is linted using the `lintr` and the `styler` package.
