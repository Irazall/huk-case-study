# Overview

This repository contains a case study that I had to work on for a job application at HUK-Coburg in 2025. The case study consists of several Quarto files that can be found in the folder `reports`. The data stems from the R-Package `CASDatasets`, Version 1.0-6 (2016) by Christophe Dutang [aut, cre], Arthur Charpentier [ctb]. The data are published [here](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=41214&status=active) (last retrieved 2025-03-07) and [here](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=41215&status=active) (last retrieved 2025-03-07). The full description of the task can be found in the file `introduction.pdf` (German only).
